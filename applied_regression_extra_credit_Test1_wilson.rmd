```{R}
library(data.table)
```

Y= Sales and X=Advert

1.  Write the simple linear regression equation.

2.  Interpret the slope and intercept terms.


```{R}
bookstore <- fread('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wilsonify/AppliedRegression/master/data/bookstore.txt')
```


```{R}
x <- bookstore$Advert
y <- bookstore$Sales
fit <- lm(y~x)
```

$$sales = \beta_0 + \beta_1 advert$$


```{R}
plot(x,y)
abline(fit)
```


```{R}
summary(fit)
```

$$sales = 326.89 + 40.10 advert$$

A unit change in advert is associated with a change in sales of 40.1. 
Under the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between advert and sales, we would observe a best fit slope at least this extreme 0.000000236% of the time.

The expected sales with zero advert is 326.89. Since there is data available with zero advert this is a reasonable estimate.
