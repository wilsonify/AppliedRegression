*Total length of literature review should be about 4 single-spaced pages or more (not counting the references page.)*

*Documented in APA style, with section headings for major sections as well as subtopics*

# Introduction

First, you will add a brief introduction to the literature review: In just a sentence or two, simply introduce the purpose and scope of the literature review, including the key issues the review will address. 

# Body
Using relevant headings, the body should be composed of sections. 
They take up each issue one at a time and discuss how the authors of the articles respond to that issue. 

Don’t forget to introduce and close each section with a sentence focused on the literature (topic sentence and concluding sentence.)

Length of body: about 3 pages or more, single-spaced. (Length of each section will vary, but each typically contains several paragraphs.)
 
# Conclusion
Summarize what the literature says about your topic. 
Approximate length: about ¼ page.
